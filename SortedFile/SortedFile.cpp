/*
Write a program that reads in a text file (input.txt), stores all of the words in a binary search tree, and outputs the word followed by a colon and a space and then the number of times it appears, one per line (result.txt). "He" and "he" are different words. Order them in proper ASCII arrangement. File will contain no punctuation. Standard rules apply.
